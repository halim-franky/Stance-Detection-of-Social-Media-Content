# The Implementation of Large Language Models to Detect Stance of Social Media Content

The expansion of the internet has connected people globally, enabling them to interact through online platforms like social media, forums, and communities. As a result, their everyday activities generate vast amounts of data, which has attracted researchers interested in understanding online behavior. This project introduces a target-specific stance detection that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and machine learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models. By employing an organized preprocessing approach, preparing annotated datasets, and fine-tuning pre-trained models, the framework delivers high accuracy in stance detection across a range of topics. The methods outlined in the project include various phases such as data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. This proposed framework is ideal for those looking to develop automated systems capable of managing large-scale stance detection tasks.
