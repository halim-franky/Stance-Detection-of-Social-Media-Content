# Stance Detection of Social Media Content using Large Language Models (LLM)

### The deepened and broadened internet network has gathered most people worldwide and allowed them to interact with each other on online platforms such as social media, online forums, and communities. Each of their daily activities has generated tremendous data, attracting many researchers willing to understand how people behave in the virtual world. This project proposes a target-based stance detection framework that employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Large Language Models (LLM) and machine learning algorithms, specifically transformer-based architecture. With a well-structured preprocessing strategy, annotated dataset preparation, and fine-tuning of pre-trained models, the framework achieves high accuracy in detecting stances across various topics. The approaches presented in the project combine multiple stages, such as data cleaning, feature extraction, model training and evaluation. The proposed framework supports those concerned about building automated systems capable of handling large-scale stance detection tasks.
